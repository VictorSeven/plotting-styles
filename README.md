# Plotting Styles
Small set of files with the usual styling I apply to all my graphs.  

It is just a bunch of python files that can be imported and are employed mostly for plot consistency. It allows some options. However, normal use is just to 

```python
import styling_funcs as mystyle

mystyle.master_format()

#Matplotlib code goes here...
```

I will add to this repo any updates and important changes to keep improving my plot aesthetics!
